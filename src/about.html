                  developing and maintaining excellent client relationships. Matt dove into the wholesale industry in
                  his early twenties by creating his first wholesaling company with his brother, Christopher. His
                  fascination with the industry continues to expand as he finds new and innovative ways to source and
                  sell merchandise. Aside from work, Matt is a travel junkie, video game lover, and food gastronome.</p>

                <span class="font-italic">Chief Operating Officer</span>
                <hr />
                <p class="text-center">Chris was first hired in 2013 as a warehouse associate and was quickly promoted
                  to
                  manager within 6 months. Chris’ research and innovative changes to the standard company procedures
                  nearly doubled the companies output. After gaining significant inside knowledge about the industry,
                  Chris and his brother Matt decided to create their own spin-off company enabling him to eventually
                  break off from his warehouse employer. Having no experience in the retail industry, he quickly gained
                  a working knowledge and hands on experience by purchasing a Snyder's Pretzel distribution business in
                  2017. He immediately observed major issues within the Direct Store Delivery (DSD) industry. This
                  knowledge allowed for NY General Wholesale to penetrate the market and grow a business by solving
                  these issues.</p>
